# UBC Course Chooser

The UBC Course Chooser application will help UBC students decide which courses they would like
to take in the future based on considering past course grade distributions, statistics, and professor ratings.
The application will allow students to search for courses based on specific parameters like
year level, subject, specific instructors, or any other statistics that they desire in a course they are looking to take.


All of the data on the UBC courses will be provided from the UBC Pair API and also it will make use of the
RateMyProfessor API in order to give students more detailed information about the instructors that teach
the courses they are looking for. Students will be able to save courses into a personalized worklist that they can 
edit and review at any time in order to help them with course registration.

This application would be extremely useful for students trying to find specific courses that suit their needs
to meet graduation requirements. Especially so for those looking into electives or lighter-load courses to balance out
their schedules. 

This project is interesting to me because I have always wanted an application like this for when I am choosing courses.
Especially in my first degree, I would always have UBC Pair and RateMyProfessor open in separate windows when trying
to find courses. However, jumping between the two became quite annoying at times and the user interface
on UBC Pair is quite dull and difficult to use in many cases (especially because of the CAPTCHA).

An application with much more flexible search parameters and one that already contains all of the necessary
information in one platform would be extremely useful for myself and a great deal of students.
